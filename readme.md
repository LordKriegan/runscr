Are you lazy like me? Or do you have so many scripts in your package.json that you can't ever remember which one you need to run? Boy is this the tool YOU need. No longer do you have to figure out which script does what, or what paramters are needed or any more nonsense like that.

From now on.... all you need to remember is this one command:

```runscr```

Yup. That's it. Nothing else. As long as you have a package.json file in your currently open directory, this will display all scripts you have available to you. Just pick one and hit enter; it will run it for you. Installation is simple as:

```npm install -g @lordkriegan/runscr```
